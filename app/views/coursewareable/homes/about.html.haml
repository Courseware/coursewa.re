      Courseware is a web platform designed to host social learning environments.
    %p
      This project started long ago in 2010, in a different environment and under
      different conditions. At that point It was an Open Source social network
      component that would bring a set of learning tools like assignments and
      gradebook to the existing environment.
    %p
      In 2012 we found out that learning platforms status is a complex and by far
      not complete market in terms of solutions and products. So we started
      Courseware, a project we believe we can build as the best learning
      management web service.
    %p
      At this point, Courseware is a self-bootstrapped venture started by a great
      team from Transylvania. Our mission is to design and build
      %em
        (necessary in that order)
      the next generation cloud based private technology to help
      people host their trainings and classes in the easiest and most affordable
      environment.
    %p
      At this point we are in a private beta program. Please
