        For the moment, you could not delete your account directly. We can process it manually after you fill the following form to inform us your request.

    .row
      = form_tag delete_request_users_path do

        .row
          .two.columns
            = label_tag(:message, _('Message'), :class => [:right, :inline])
          .ten.columns
            = text_area_tag(:message, nil, :rows => 7, :required => true, :placeholder => _('Why do you want to leave?'))

        .row
          .ten.columns.offset-by-two
            = submit_tag(_('Send request'), :class => 'button primary')

= render(:partial => 'sidebar')
